Flaming CVE Reader is designed to lookup CVEs which are hot topics of the day within Cyber Security blogs. It send CVEs that are "hot off" the press as well as older CVEs which for whatever reason are being talked about in prominent Cyber blogs.

It is designed to compliment your existing threat intel monitoring processes. In some cases Zero Day vulnerabilities are so new they are yet to be rated and assigned a CVE number - in these cases this tool will not know about it so it is important to understand it's limitations. There is also value in personnell reading security blogs to better understand the threat landscape which is why I reccomend this as an additional 'catch all process' rather than replace anything. 

Integrates with Slack & Jira

Useful when used in conjuction with your existing security tools such as Defender for Endpoint. See example [Click Here.](https://github.com/samlambert563/flaming-cve-reader/blob/main/useful-queries/CVE-Lookup-KQL-Query) or Kibana once ingesting CVE IDs from your vulnerability management platform.

It comes in x 3 flavours to cater for a number of scenarios.
* **SMTP** - For use cases where you wish to tightly control incoming data (can be used in conjunction with email whitelisting or hosted internally) / this verison can also can be used with emails to alert addresses for easy integration with your ticket system if supported.
* **Incoming Webhook** - Supported with Slack and Teams - Basic version that sends CVE numbers to IM with hyperlinks /buttons so it can be easily linked to a standard operating procedure, policy or security product/query.
