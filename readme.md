"Flaming CVE Reader" is designed to lookup CVEs which are hot topics of the day within Cyber Security blogs. It will pull off CVEs that are "hot off" the press as well as older CVEs which for whatever reason are being talked about in prominent Cyber blogs. 

It is designed to compliment your existing threat intel monitoring processes. In some cases Zero Day vulnerabilities are so new they are yet to be rated and assigned a CVE number - in these cases this tool will not know about it so it is important to understand it's limitations.

It does works well when incorporated into your Security operations BAU activity as running a quick lookup of all CVEs can be in a few seconds. For example you can lookup the CVEs using the Advanced Threat Hunting feature in Defender for Endpoint. 

Consider using it to send to a teams channel that is monitored or direct to a service desk ticket system.
Happy Hunting!
